# ArgoCD GitOps Lab

This repository serves as a hands-on lab exploring GitOps practices with ArgoCD, focusing on automating deployments and utilizing infrastructure as code principles.

## Objective

The primary objective of this lab is to demonstrate GitOps implementation using the listed technologies:

- Terraform: for provisioning AWS infrastructure
- GitHub: for version control
- ArgoCD: for Continuous Deployment (CD)

Emphasis is placed on the CD aspect rather than CI, showcasing automated deployment workflows and the orchestration of infrastructure through code.
